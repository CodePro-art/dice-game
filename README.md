# WEEKEND PROJECT
## Dice Game
---
### `RULES:`
* The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
* In each turn, a player rolls 2 dices as many times as he wishes.
* Each result will get added to his round’s score.
* But if the player rolls a double six all his round’s score gets lost.
* After that, its the next player’s turn.
* A player can choose to ‘Hold’, which means that his round’s score
* gets added to his global score. After that, its the next players turn.
* The first player to reach 100 points wins.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
